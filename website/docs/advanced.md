# Advanced usage

## Memory management

In most cases, memory management of native resources is automatically taken care of. Java-GI uses GObject toggle references to dispose the native object when the Java instance is garbage-collected, and manages all memory allocations for marshaling of string, array and struct parameters.

### Allocating structs with an Arena
Struct definitions (in contrast to GObjects) in native code are mapped to Java classes. Because structs don't necessarily have a constructor method, the Java classes offer an `allocate()` method to allocate a new uninitialized struct. To determine the size of the struct and its members, the memory layouts have been generated from the field definitions in the gir files.

Java-GI requires an `Arena` to allocate memory for these instances. Users can choose between different arenas in OpenJDK, depending on the use case. All `allocate()` methods generated by Java-GI for record (struct) and union types expect an Arena as the first parameter.

Example:
```java
try (var arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var red = RGBA.allocate(arena, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
    // memory is now allocated
}
// memory is now deallocated

var blue = RGBA.allocate(Arena.ofAuto(), 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
// memory will be deallocated when the variable is garbage collected

var green = RGBA.allocate(Arena.global(), 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
// memory will be allocated during the entire application runtime
```

Read the OpenJDK [Arena](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/foreign/Arena.html) documentation for more information.

To ease the transition, in Java-GI version 0.8, the old `allocate()` methods without an Arena parameter are still available. These methods use an `Arena.ofAuto()` behind the scenes. Dealing with native memory deallocations during GC is rather ugly, so the `Arena.ofAuto()` should preferrably not be the default option. Therefore, these methods have been marked as `deprecated`, and will be removed in the next Java-GI release.

## Builder pattern

You can construct an object with GObject properties using a Builder pattern. For example, to create a new ApplicationWindow:

```java
var window = ApplicationWindow.builder()
    .setApplication(this)
    .setTitle("Window")
    .setDefaultWidth(300)
    .setDefaultHeight(200)
    .build();
```

With a `Builder` you can set the properties of the class, its parents, and all implemented interfaces. Behind the scenes, this will call `g_object_new_with_properties()`.

## Exceptions

`GError**` parameters are mapped to Java `GErrorException`s.

```java
try {
    file.replaceContents(contents, null, false, FileCreateFlags.NONE, null, null);
} catch (GErrorException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

Use `GErrorException.getCode()`, `getDomain()` and `getMessage()` to get the GError code, domain and message. Java-GI does not generate separate Exception types for different GError domains, because the domain is only set at runtime.

## Nullable/NotNull parameter annotations

Nullability of parameters (as defined in the GObject-introspection attributes) is indicated with `@Nullable` and `@NotNull` attributes, and checked at runtime. The nullability annotations are imported from Jetbrains Annotations.

## Arrays

C functions that work with arrays, often expect the array length as an additional parameter. In the corresponding Java methods, that parameter is unnecessary, because Java-GI will set it automatically.

## Out-parameters

Out-parameters are mapped to a simple `Out<T>` container-type in Java, that offers typesafe `get()` and `set()` methods to retrieve or modify the value.

```java
File file = ...
Out<byte[]> contents = new Out<byte[]>();
file.loadContents(null, contents, null));
System.out.printf("Read %d bytes\n", contents.get().length);
```

## Varargs

Variadic functions are available in Java using varargs:

```java
Dialog d = Dialog.withButtons(
        "Test dialog",
        window,
        DialogFlags.MODAL,
        "Accept",
        ResponseType.ACCEPT,
        "Cancel",
        ResponseType.CANCEL,
        null
);
d.show();
```

Be aware that with most variadic functions in GLib, you are expected to add `null` as a final parameter.

**Note:** Java-GI does not provide bindings for functions with a `va_list` parameter.

## Signals and callbacks

Signals are mapped to type-safe methods and objects in Java. (Detailed signals like `notify` have an extra `String` parameter.) A signal can be connected to a lambda expression or method reference:

```java
var button = Button.withLabel("Close");
button.onClicked(window::close);
```

For every signal, a method to connect (e.g. `onClicked`) and emit the signal (`emitClicked`) is included in the API. New signal connections return a `Signal` object, that allows you to disconnect, block and unblock a signal, or check whether the signal is still connected.

Functions with callback parameters are supported too. The generated Java bindings contain `@FunctionalInterface` definitions for all callback functions to ensure type safety.

## Closures

[Closures](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/struct.Closure.html) can be marshaled to Java methods. Similar to the `CClosure` type in C code, Java-GI offers a [JavaClosure](https://jwharm.github.io/java-gi/javadoc/io/github/jwharm/javagi/gobject/JavaClosure.html). You can create a JavaClosure for a lambda fuction or a `java.lang.reflect.Method` and then pass it to native code (for example, the last two parameters of [`GObject.bindPropertyFull()`](https://jwharm.github.io/java-gi/glib/org.gnome.glib/org/gnome/gobject/GObject.html#bindPropertyFull(java.lang.String,org.gnome.gobject.GObject,java.lang.String,org.gnome.gobject.BindingFlags,org.gnome.gobject.Closure,org.gnome.gobject.Closure))).

Be aware that the Java lambda or method references that is wrapped in a JavaClosure must have the correct signature, or else the application will fail at runtime. Closures cannot be type-checked by the compiler!
